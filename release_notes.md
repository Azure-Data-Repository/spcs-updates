# Snowpark Container Services Limited PrPr Release Notes

This page contains release notes for past and upcoming behavior changes for the limited Private Preview of Snowpark Container Services (SPCS). 

SPCS is a new product offered by Snowflake, so it sees frequent updates and occasional behavior changes at this stage of the product development lifecycle. As such, this document is meant to keep early users informed of recent and upcoming user-visible changes. This page is considered the most up-to-date source of truth for user-facing changes; there is some delay in making changes to the [public documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowpark-containers/overview).

**Note**: Run `SELECT CURRENT_VERSION()` to see the current version of Snowflake in your account.

| Synchronous job runs | Enables running of jobs in a synchronous fashion. I.e., job execution (`EXECUTE SERVICE`) commands do not return until the job is complete. Returns with a message saying “Execution \<Query UUID\> completed successfully.”<br><br>Before this change, jobs executed asynchronously and job execution commands returned with “Execution submitted successfully as \<Query UUID\>.” | NOT RELEASED |
| Service auto-resume  | Enables users to specify the `AUTO_RESUME` boolean parameter to control whether to automatically resume a compute pool when a service or job is submitted to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | NOT RELEASED |

| Defer Ingress URL display for 120s after Service creation                           | Enables behavior in which there is a 120 second delay after a service is created before ingress URL is provisioned.<br><br>After a service is created, running `SHOW SERVICES` will display “Endpoints provisioning in progress... check back in a few minutes” for the public endpoint URL to allow time for dns provisioning and prevent users from entering the url in browser when the dns entry isn't present.<br><br>If you have automation on service endpoint fetching, please update your scripts to wait for the provisioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 7.32    | In progress                                                                                                            |

| Service creation from inline spec syntax change                                     | Enables SQL syntax change that allows creation of services and jobs from an inline specification. The new syntax is as follows:<br><br>Creating a service from an inline spec:<br>```CREATE SERVICE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] <name> IN COMPUTE POOL <compute_pool_name> FROM SPECIFICATION $$ ... $$;```<br><br>Creating a job from an inline spec:<br>```EXECUTE SERVICE IN COMPUTE POOL <compute_pool_name> FROM SPECIFICATION $$ … $$ [ USING ([ ARG1 = <arg1>, ARG2 = <arg2>, ... ])]```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 7.31    | In progress                                                                                                            |
| Disruptive Cluster Upgrade                                                          | Enables automatic disruptive cluster upgrades on all accounts.<br><br>As part of cluster upgrades, Snowflake will automatically deploy new OS, software, drivers and fix security vulnerabilities to compute pool nodes.<br>Customers should expect some downtime every 14 to 21 days after cluster creation/re-creation date during the maintenance period. The maintenance period runs every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 12 am to 5 am.<br><br>As part of the upgrades, all instances in the compute pools belonging to an account will be recreated. All services running in those compute pools will be recreated on the new instances. All jobs will be disrupted and customers will have to restart them once the Compute pool is ready. The expected downtime is approximately 30 minutes. | 7.30    | In progress                                                                                                            |
