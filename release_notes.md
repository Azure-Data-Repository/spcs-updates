# Snowpark Container Services Limited PrPr Release Notes

This page contains release notes for past and upcoming behavior changes for the limited Private Preview of Snowpark Container Services (SPCS). 

SPCS is a new product offered by Snowflake, so it sees frequent updates and occasional behavior changes at this stage of the product development lifecycle. As such, this document is meant to keep early users informed of recent and upcoming user-visible changes. This page is considered the most up-to-date source of truth for user-facing changes; there is some delay in making changes to the [public documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowpark-containers/overview).

**Note**: Run `SELECT CURRENT_VERSION()` to see the current version of Snowflake in your account.

| Feature              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Release      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Default compute pool auto suspend interval | Sets the default `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS` parameter value for a compute pool to to 3600s (i.e., 1 hour). The current behavior does not set an auto-suspend parameter for a new compute pool. Moving forward, any compute pool that is unused will be automatically suspended after 1 hour unless there is an explicit value for `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS`. | Est. 7.37 |
| Synchronous job runs | Enables running of jobs in a synchronous fashion. I.e., job execution (`EXECUTE SERVICE`) commands do not return until the job is complete. Returns with a message saying “Execution \<Query UUID\> completed successfully.”<br><br>Additionally enables the usage of the `system$cancel_query(<QUERY_UUID>)` syntax to cancel a job.<br><br>Before this change, jobs execute asynchronously and job execution commands return with “Execution submitted successfully as \<Query UUID\>.” | Early October |
| Autoscaling of services activated      | Activates horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | NOT RELEASED           |
| Autoscaling of compute pools activated | Activates compute pool autoscaling by default. After you create a compute pool, Snowflake launches the minimum number of nodes and automatically creates additional nodes up to the maximum allowed. This is called autoscaling. New nodes are allocated when the running nodes do not have capacity to take any additional workload. | UP (7.34), DOWN (7.36) |
| User Logs Default Level                | User logs default level will be changed from \`INFO\` to \`NONE\`. Meaning that by default user logs ingestion to event tables will be off                                                                                                                                                                                            | NOT RELEASED           |

| Service auto-resume  | Enables automatic resume of a service when there is ingress to the service or invocation of a service function exposed by the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 7.34 | [Yes](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowpark-containers/reference/service#create-service) |
| Defer Ingress URL display for 120s after Service creation                           | Enables behavior in which there is a 120 second delay after a service is created before ingress URL is provisioned.<br><br>After a service is created, running `SHOW SERVICES` will display “Endpoints provisioning in progress... check back in a few minutes” for the public endpoint URL to allow time for dns provisioning and prevent users from entering the url in browser when the dns entry isn't present.<br><br>If you have automation on service endpoint fetching, please update your scripts to wait for the provisioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 7.32    | In progress                                                                                                            |

| Service creation from inline spec syntax change                                     | Enables SQL syntax change that allows creation of services and jobs from an inline specification.

The maintenance period runs every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 12 am to 5 am.<br><br>As part of the upgrades, all instances in the compute pools belonging to an account will be recreated. All services running in those compute pools will be recreated on the new instances. All jobs will be disrupted and customers will have to restart them once the Compute pool is ready.

| Dynamic validation of GPU requests                                                  | Enables multi-GPU scenarios and dynamic validation of service GPU requests based on the number of GPUs available in the selected compute pool instance type. The previous service creation flow did not allow a service to request more than 1 GPU regardless of the number available in the compute pool, except by enabling it customer by customer basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 7.28    | [Yes](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowpark-containers/specification-reference#containers-resources-field)                                                                                                            |
